**1. Components & Preliminaries**

- **Raspberry Pi Zero**
- **PiSugar Battery**
- **Alfa WiFi Adapter**
- **Micro SD Card**: Installed with Raspbian Lite (screenless operation optimized)

---

**2. Assembly & Configuration**

a. **Power Integration**: Attach the PiSugar battery to the Raspberry Pi Zero.
  
b. **Adapter Connection**: Securely connect the Alfa WiFi Adapter into the Pi Zero's USB portal.

c. **System Preparation**:
    - Flash Raspbian Lite onto the Micro SD Card.
    - Ensure SSH is enabled for remote access by placing a file named `ssh` (without any extension) in the boot partition. Or make sure it is checked when configuring Raspbian via Raspberry Pi Imager.

d. **Network Essentials**:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install wireshark tshark
```

---

**3. Automating the Etherial Awakening**

To ensure that Wireshark’s `tshark` (the terminal version suitable for our screenless setup) starts capturing on boot:

a. **Create a Script**:
```
sudo nano /home/pi/start_tshark.sh
```

In the script, write:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
tshark -i [YourAlfaAdapterName] -w /path/to/store/captures/audit_$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S").pcap
```

Save and exit.

b. **Make it Executable**:
```
sudo chmod +x /home/pi/start_tshark.sh
```

c. **Automate on Boot**:
```
sudo crontab -e
```

Add the following line to the end:
```
@reboot /home/pi/start_tshark.sh
```

---

**4. Activating & Deploying**

Power on the Etherian Auditor. As it awakens, it will commence its capturing ritual automatically, gleaning from the unseen currents.

---

**5. Data Retrieval & Archiving**

Without a screen, you'll harness the power of SSH to interface:

a. **Access via SSH**: On a terminal from another device:
```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```
(Ensure you're on the same network and the default password is `raspberry` unless changed.)

b. **Retrieval**: Use `scp` or similar tools to transfer the pcap files to your local machine for further analysis.

c. **Archiving**: Always encrypt your data for preservation and protection:
```
gpg -c /path/to/audit_file.pcap
```
You’ll be prompted for a passphrase. This encrypts the file, ensuring its sanctity.

The Scribe now stands as a sentinel, ready to decipher the digital murmurs. Handle with care, honor the spaces you tread, and delve deep into the revelations it brings forth.
